#  Moderation Flow
## Introduction
Below diagram show the flow of moderation system we propose.There are four stage included, which are license check, version check, Quality check and similarity check.

* License check:
Moderators check the license based on the information provided by uploaders. If moderators have doubts, they can contact uploader for more information.

* Version check:
Moderators check the version from three aspect "uploaders", "title" and "content". When the uploader, title and content are exactly. This upload content would be judged as duplicated. If uploader and title are the same, but only mostly content is the same. Moderators could archive the order version and continue reviewing newer version.

* Quality check:
The judgment criteria of quality check mainly focuses on topic fitness and confirm whether all selected attributes are suitable.
