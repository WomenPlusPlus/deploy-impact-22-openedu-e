## Search engine

We built an experimental semantic search engine for the OpenEdu platform by building and deploying a demo app on Python using the Streamlit library. The engine processes the text input provided in the search bar, queries the content currently available on the SQL database dump provided, and provides a list with 10 resources that best match (in semantic similarity terms) the search query. The app is up and running (temporarily) at this [link on the Streamlit cloud](https://slashlan-test-streamlit-openedu-search-engine-app-test-0qqrve.streamlit.app/).
