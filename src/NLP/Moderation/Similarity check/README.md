# Similarity check
The Similarity check functionality is part of the quality check steps executed by the moderator as shown in the Moderator board template (link). This functionality uses the text description of new content submitted by the contributor, compares it with what currently stored on the OpenEdu, and shows to the moderator a list with the 3 most similar resources already available on the platform to double-check to avoid material duplication.

The `Duplicates_main.py` stores all the functions needed to execute the Similarity check functionality. In short, this script cleans and breaks text in sentences, produces word embeddings (i.e., vectors in a multidimensional space), calculates cosine similarity (scale -1 to 1, with 1 being identical text and -1 being opposite) and shows the top 3 most similar texts. The script foresees the adoption of a pre-trained semantic transformer model (SBERT models) that must be specified at the beginning before executing (we suggest using all-MiniLM-L6-v2).

Ideally, the script should be integrated in a Django upload form interface together with the other functionalities related to the Moderator board template.

The `Duplicates_test.ipynb` shows a practical test of the functionality by using the current OpenEdu content available on the SQL database dump provided.
