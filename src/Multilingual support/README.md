====================
Multilingual forms
====================

This app uses 'django-parler' and 'gettext_lazy' to create multilingual support for the ontology. 
More in detail, django-parler creates additional fields for attributes that are language dependent, for example title, description and url, while gettext_lazy provides translations for labels and templates without requiring duplication.

The app contains templates to an homepage with a list of resources, two forms to upload resources (one with the initial information in one language choice of the user and a second one to add the fields in additional languages), a thank you for your submission page and a page to see the single resource in detail.

The app itself is in the '/forms' folder.
I have also included my settings.py file and '/locale' folder to help in case of confusion.

Quick start
-----------
1. Copy the '/forms' folder inside the project folder.

2. Add "parler" to your INSTALLED_APPS setting like this::

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        ...
        'parler',
    ]
    
    and "LocaleMiddleware" to MIDDLEWARE right after 'django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware',
    MIDDLEWARE = [
    ....
    'django.middleware.locale.LocaleMiddleware',
    ...
]

3. Add language information to the settings file (list of languages can of course be different). 
   'locale' will be the location where the .po and .mo files are located. Create the 'locale' folder the project folder.

   from django.utils.translation import gettext_lazy as _

LANGUAGES = (
    ('en', _('English')),
    ('fr', _('French')),
    ('it', _('Italian')),
    ('de', _('German')),
)

PARLER_LANGUAGES = {
    None: (
        {'code': 'en',}, # English
        {'code': 'fr',}, # French
        {'code': 'it',}, # Italian
        {'code': 'de',}, # German
    ),
    'default': {
        'fallbacks': ['en'],
        'hide_untranslated': False,
    }
}


LOCALE_PATHS = [
    BASE_DIR / 'locale/',
]

4. Include the forms URLconf in your project urls.py like this::

    path('forms/', include('forms.urls')),

5. Run ``python manage.py migrate`` to create the resource model.

6. Run ``django-admin makemessages --all`` to create the structure in the '/locale' folder as well as the .po files for the translation of the labels and templates. Current ones are available in the \locale folder.
   Once they po files are updated run ``django-admin compilemessages`` to create the .mo files

7. Start the development server and visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
   to manage the resources (you'll need the Admin app enabled). 
   Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/newresource/ to add a new resource

8. Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/ to see the resources.
