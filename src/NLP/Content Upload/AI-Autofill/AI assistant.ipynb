Prasad was the Chief Business Officer of Myntra and was instrumental in shaping Myntraï¿½s strategy and growth over the last 4-5 years. Both are technologists and led Myntra through industry shaping moves, be it building a premium consumer brand, leading the way in m-commerce or creating growth with technology and consumer experience. They grew passionate about consumer internet opportunities in India as they built Myntra to be a billion dollar online fashion platform from ground up.\\nmfine is the venture they started after moving on from Myntra in Jan 2017. They have put together a very strong initial team that brings with it technology, business and healthcare experience/expertise.\\n[Platform] mfineï¿½s platform manifests into a consumer app and a care team app (for doctors and care team). The apps are powered with AI/BOTs that enrich the interaction between the consumers and doctors, make the clinic workflows efficient and deliver a proactive care experience for the users with personalized information/notifications. The App is the go to place for all data for the consumers and providers - be it historical records or real time streaming from connected health devices. At the backend of the apps is the integration with provider network that enables smooth admin & operations between mfine and each provider.\\nCompany Details:\\nIndustry: Healthcare\\nCompany Incorporation: Feb 2017\\nNo of Employees: 130\\nGeography: Bangalore\\nFounders:\\nPrasad Kompalli (CEO & Co-founder) : https://www.linkedin.com/in/prasadkompalli/\\nAshutosh Lawania (Co-founder) : https://www.linkedin.com/in/lawania/\\nAjit Narayanan (CTO) : https://www.linkedin.com/in/ajitnarayanan/\\nJD of Data Scientist (NLP) \\nHere are some areas where based on your choice & experience you would be working on:\\nBe the AI champion in the team, own the AI modelï¿½s success from concept level to production deployment and successful optimization\\nBuild/Enhance NLP/ML models for various components within our NLP stack (see our current stack)\\nScaling/Optimizing AI models for various verticals, languages, and clients\\nBring in a greater degree of reinforcement learning capability to all AI components in the platform\\nStay current with the latest research in AI space, relevant to our platform, and lead the effort to experiment/apply them to help constantly improve the platform\\n25.',\n",
