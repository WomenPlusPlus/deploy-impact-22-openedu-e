## Similarity check
The Similarity check functionality is part of the quality check steps executed by the moderator as shown in the Moderator board template (link). This functionality uses the text description of new content submitted by the contributor, compares it with what currently stored on the OpenEdu, and shows to the moderator a list with the 3 most similar resources already available on the platform to double-check to avoid material duplication. More details in the [Similarity check folder](https://github.com/WomenPlusPlus/deploy-impact-22-openedu-e/tree/Restructure/src/NLP/Moderation/Similarity%20check).
